Limit form submission per user for your Ninja Forms

== Description ==
= Simply limit form submissions per user =

You can set a timeout for submissions per user so you can make sure a user doesn\'t submit a form too often. This is especially useful if you use NinjaForms for any kind of votings for example when you create a photo contest with [Ninja Forms Multimedia Fields](http://etzelstorfer.com/en/downloads/ninja-forms-multimedia-field/).

= No need to register users =

Of course a cookie is not as save as validating logged in users but it is fast and simple and you don\'t force your visitors to create an account.

= For all kind of votings and polls =

Check out the image voting demo [here](http://ninjaforms-multimedia.demos.haet.at/)
